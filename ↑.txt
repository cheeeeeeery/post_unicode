↑ wants to be on top, but there are always things higher than ↑, taller than ↑, stronger than ↑, and prettier than ↑. ↑ cry but he couldn’t even see the teardrop. ↑ wants to shout but the position of looking up numb ↑’s throat and sound. ↑ has never seen his reflection in the mirror, therefore, ↑ only know himself from others’ opinion. ↑ looks up but ↑ is always down.

↑ is in a panic because of his position of looking up and moving forward. ↑ is afraid of what is in the back, in the front, and in the future. D is a robot and a friend. D doesn’t have emotions. ↑ asked D for comfort and help. D is surprised ↑ is down. For D, it is very confusing that ↑ is down since the blue motion doesn’t exist in the robotic world. They hugged but ↑ is not better, and D feels nothing.
