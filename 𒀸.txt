𒀸

𒀸 is a person who is in pain. 𒀸's pain is not seeable at all. 𒀸 experienced it inside 𒀸's belly, head, eyes, and soul. 𒀸 don't cry. 𒀸 thinks tear is for sadness but the pain 𒀸 is experiencing is madness. 𒀸 feels like everything she touches are spiky and offensive. 𒀸 is with pain that doesn't have its reason.

It's 23:30. 𒀸 scrolled on social media after doing the daily dishes. On social media, C shared that she won a championship for a well-known award. C is a proud sibling of 𒀸 who has the confidence of gold and the ability of god. When C aims for a goal, she goes for it without anything stopping her, even mountains of dishes, an empty fridge, hunger, or even herself.

𒀸 felt extremely happy about C's achievement but at the same time anxiety grows bigger and bigger while scrolling through her social media. 𒀸's breathing got heavier this time and this strange emotion was just like a dagger in 𒀸's heart. The ache of the soul is alerting. The blocks of feeds of social media are laughing at 𒀸 for her ugly pain. Suddenly, C’s message came and asked, “what are you doing recently?” 𒀸 says no word. Actually, 𒀸 has nothing to say. The nothingness crash 𒀸. The aches became angry emotions because 𒀸 has not done anything but dishes, laundry, groceries, and counting pennies. 𒀸 felt helpless. Or a better word, 𒀸 is jealous of C. 𒀸 cried but not with tears but with blood that comes out of 𒀸's heart. 𒀸 is just too ashamed to admit the jealousy so it grows into unspoken pain.
