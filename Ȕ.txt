Ȕ is a person who is afraid to be forgotten. Ȕ’s life goal is to not bother anyone. Ȕ thinks Ȕ doesn’t worth it. Ȕ micro self into a tiny tiny bit. The only thing left is a smile. Ȕ is kind to anyone. Ȕ help whoever asks for help. Fulfilling others makes Ȕ feel valuable and not being forgotten, but the only thing Ȕ want others only remember is the smile.

B is a neighbour. She texted Ȕ, “I need to tell you something!” Ȕ is afraid. Ȕ doesn’t know what Ȕ has done that needs to require a talk. Ȕ stares at the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence and considers it might be a serious problem that B wants to talk about. Ȕ starts to recall what happened nowadays that might bothered B.

“Maybe it was yesterday that I was too tired so I didn’t give nice responses?”
“Maybe it was the last time we ate dinner together and I accidentally ate the last piece of bean?”
“Maybe I forgot my headphones frequently, so she got mad that I borrowed them too often?”
“Or maybe it was my exhaustiveness yesterday disturbing her a bit?”
Ȕ is so nervous. Ȕ thinks Ȕ got too close to B so Ȕ became relaxed sometimes. It might be that Ȕ crosses the line or be not polite.

”knock knock.“ B is back. Ȕ opens the door with a smile, but actually, Ȕ is almost crying. Ȕ asked with a trembling voice, “What’s wrong?” B answered with excitement, “I brought a new fish! Then the fish in the aquarium will not be alone anymore!”
