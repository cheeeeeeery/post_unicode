~ is a person with long and wavy hair. ~’s wavy hair is in front of her eyes, in her ears and invading her brain. ~‘s head is too heavy to think. ~ always hears noises when people say things. ~‘s world is dark since she has to see things in between her long and wavy hair.

Today, ~ has an enormous headache. ~ gave her long hair a hot bath but the moisture just made it even heavier. ~‘s neck has to tilt and let her hair flow on one side, and 10 minute on the other side to keep the balance.

“How is this even possibly bare-able?” ~ questioned herself.

Outside, it is thundering and lightning. ~‘s head hurts like a nutshell that is about to crack. There is no light in ~’s eyes, but her eyes are hurting so much. ~ opens the fan to blow her hair and cool down her brain. The fan is trying its best but the hair is just too heavy, it doesn’t move an inch. ~ wants her short hair back. The short hair that flies freely in the wind. The short hair that doesn’t bother ~ in her mind, the iconic short hair that looks like nothing else but ~ herself. ~’s hair now takes a lot of courage and time to look this wavy and nice. The time ~ spends on her hair is longer than the moment she likes herself. The sad thing is, people around ~ think the wavy long hair IS ~.

~ got tons of compliments for having wavy long hair.
“I like you in this, you look so pretty!” A once said.
“Why does ~ keep short hair all these years? She looks amazing with wavy long hair” A’s mom said to A.
“You look so much better. I love the new you!” M said. ~ got triggered and asked, “Why is that?” M responds, “Well… it is not like you were ugly, but you know… THIS is the thing everyone appreciated and wanted to see. It sparks you!”

So that’s it. ~’s original short hair is in fact not likable, advertisable, desirable and valuable. The world wants the ~ that has to struggle with long, tangled hair. The world wants ~ to have less time for thinking but untangle the mess the whole day. It is not what ~ used to, not what ~ enjoy doing, not what ~ is. ~ hate her long hair, but it is too far, ~ can’t cut it. ~’s hair is in her eyes, in her ears, in the tea she is drinking and the path she is stepping on. Everything including ~’s uncertain heart is now successfully covered by her long hair.

~ gazes at the world in between her hair and whispers, “At least you are successful, I can not do anything about you. I can not cut you. I can not un-see you. Although you are nothing like me, you are me now.”


- Bonus Story -

There is no one who can untie ~'s long tangle wavy hair. There is a way that eases the pressure of the heavy hair. ~ sometimes go to the river and float like a star. The water replaces the wind and carry ~'s hair for her. Her face can finally be in front of her hair and she gets to look at the full sky while floating. Of course, it is not allowed to float forever on the river because boats go by and people say hi. The only possible way is to float on an open sea where no one sees. However, ~ is not ready for this commitment yet.
~ is tiptoeing the lake and not having the full courage to go for the whole open water. It is sad, but the hair is growing inside out but not outside in. So, somehow it is ~'s decision to stay with this wavy long hair. ~ did this to herself.
